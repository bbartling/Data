["the supply fan speed mean is over 90% like the fan isnt building static, mean value recorded is 100.", "the supply fan is running, the VFD speed output mean value is 100.", "the supply fan VFD speed doesnt appear to be changing, the min speed reference minus the max is the same value.", "the duct pressure appears to be low averaging under .5\" WC, the mean value is 0.4, I wonder if there is a fan capacity issue.", "the duct temp went over 65F, max value recorded is 69.0", "the ahu does not appear to be in a cooling mode, the discharge temp is above 60F", "the return temp mean is low, under 70F the mean value recorded is 71. Does the building need heat, check the boilers??"]
